                                    Imagine you spent five entire years building up a YouTube channel. You started small. You struggled to get viewership. Through thick and thin, you eventually achieved the attention of thousands to millions of fans worldwide. The content you produce is unique, entertaining, and authentic to whom you are as a content creator. Each view, henceforth, brought you a steady stream, of income from ad revenue. You were finally free to turn this YouTube hobby into a full-time job.<br />
                                    Out of nowhere, YouTube updates its monetization policies, which sends all that potential revenue down the gutter. Why? Because you said “fuck” in the first 5 minutes of your video. Maybe you voiced an “unwanted” opinion on Twitter and cancel culture is coming for you, Maybe an old video on YouTube you uploaded was now determined to be “misinformation.” Now you have to compromise your creative vision you had for your channel to the millions of fans that subscribed to you, which you may end up losing anyways because you are no longer producing the media they followed you for.
